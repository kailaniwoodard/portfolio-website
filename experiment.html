									<h1>Performing Mad<br />
									Science in the Nick of Time...</h1>
									<p>Not really...</p>
								</header>
								<h2>What's the Goal Here?</h2>
									<p>The goal of this experimentation, if you could really call
                  what's going on here experimental in any form was to determine
                  that even the most rudimentary form of my prototype for my
                  proposed research would perform intended functions. The intended
                  functions here are tracing eye movement using the prototype
                  software that I developed.</p>
								<h2>How Are You Gonna Experiment That?</h2>
									<p>The primary issue that I came across in performing an
                  experiment was finding what could be easily be experimented
                  with the prototype I have developed.</p>
                  <p>The prototype that I developed was intended to demonstrate
                  the ability to trace eye movement and show that I could add a
                  visual indicator to go along with this traced movement to ensure
                  that I could do so.</p>
                <h2>So What Did I Do?</h2>
                  <p>I demonstrated to myself in an incredibly primitive way that
                  I was able to collect data based on the position of the highlighted
                  area in the video (this being the red circles that trace the movement
                  of the pupil) and ensure by "eyeballing" it that it showed potential
                  to produce results.</p>
                  <p>I admit that I struggled to develop a prototype for a while and
                  that, among other things, contributed to my non-traditional approach
                  to completing these preliminary steps to proposing my project. As a
                  result, becoming happy with the product I created did not leave a lot
                  of opportunity to experiment, however I feel that I created software
                  or at least a good baseline for what technology needs created to
                  pursue my intended research.</p>
