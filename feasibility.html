									<h1>How Feasible<br />
									is it Really?</h1>
									<p>Discussing if I'm really reaching for the stars.</p>
								</header>
								<h2>What are the Qualifiers for Feasibility?</h2>
									<p>When exploring the feasibility of research, it is certainly
                  important to consider each of the fine details to ensure that
                  the intended pursuit of research is plain-out achievable to
                  begin with.</p>
									<p>Here, I'm just going to be discussing some points briefly to
                  validate the feasibility of my proposed research project.</p>
								<h2>Hardware</h2>
									<p>I'm anticipating fairly reasonable requirements with hardware
                  when considering the initial research I want to perform. Putting
                  it simply, I would need a machine with the minimum system requirements of: </p>
									<p><i>1080p @ 30 FPS or 720p @ 60 FPS webcam</i></p>
                  <p><i>Windows 10 or macOS X</i></p>
                  <p><i>4-core Intel processor, 3GHz or faster, 5th gen or later.</i></p>
                  <p><i>DirectX 12 graphics card (with updated drivers, of course)</i></p>
                  <p>This requirement is already met on the level that is necessary for
                  initial conduct of research, however for the artistic presentation,
                  there is still not a certain plan for the exact hardware required,
                  which is pending upon proposal approval and accessibility to funding.</p>
								<h2>Tools</h2>
									<p>I plan to write my eye tracking software with Python, as it is fitting
                  to use the language for this type of purpose, especially considering the
                  libraries available in Python.</p>
				          <p>Some tools and resources that I anticipate using in my research are: </p>
                  <p><b><a href="https://pytorch.org/">Pytorch</a></b></p>
                  <p><b><a href="https://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a></b></p>
									<p>These have their own reasons for being helpful, but both generally
                  contribute to helping use existing resources to develop a program that
                  does exactly as I want without having to reinvent the wheel.</p>
								<h2>Data and Anticipated Results</h2>
									<p>In regards to data for the project, it will need generated and
                  I am operating under the assumption that this data will be generated
                  by a participation study that I will have to conduct. I plan to store
                  my findings in a local database, likely using SQLite or MySQL.</p>
									<p>The kind of results I expect to yield from this experiment
                  would ultimately aide me in supporting my proposed hypothesis
                  about the male gaze, but generally needs to be able to collect
                  the values that a pupil will be positioned in the webcam feed
                  or video and the path that is created by putting these values
                  together.</p>
                  <p>The analysis of the data would be conducted heavily through
                  comparison and finding common attributes per participant in the
                  study, then consider the concepts attached to the "male gaze"
                  theory to further come to a conclusion and also use these
                  findings in my artistic presentation.</p>
								<h2>Do I Feel Like I Can Do It?</h2>
									<p>I am incredibly confident in my intellectual and general
                  computational ability to assist in the completion of this
                  project, I feel that with the time given and the automation
                  that can be performed with data analysis based on what I
                  collect, a heavy amount of the work will rely on further
                  research and drawing connections to support my hypothesis.</p>
