									<h1>Why Is It So Hard To Accept The Party Is Over</h1>
									<p>Why Is It So Hard To Accept The Party Is Over is a collection
                    of partially staged images that hold their focus in imitating
                    the atmosphere of college parties or perhaps the emotional
                    processing associated with being under the influence in that
                    sort of environment. This connects to the ultimate deeper
                    meaning of escapism and mania associated with the artist’s
                    very own disorders, those being bipolar disorder II and
                    borderline personality disorder. Each of the images in this
                    project incorporate purple lighting because of the color’s
                    composition between red and blue. Red and blue are ultimately
                    used as devices to convey the blend of depression and hypomania
                    associated with bipolar disorder, with blue representing
                    depression and red representing hypomania respectively. In the
                    photos, the model is wearing a red top to represent the manic
                    or hypomanic side of bipolar disorder and wears purple makeup
                    to represent the mix between the two aspects of the disorder.
                    The makeup also takes aesthetic inspiration from the American
                    drama, Euphoria, to emphasize the association with struggles
                    with substance abuse and the clear intent or lack of intent
                    in “staying clean”. This allusion is used to further drive home
                    the meaning behind Why Is It So Hard To Accept The Party Is Over.
                    In a technical sense, the images are shot with a purple flash
                    and edited to imitate the aesthetics of a disposable film camera.
                    This is achieved through purple tape over the flash of the camera
                    and editing within Adobe Photoshop to create the illusion of
                    capturing “Kodak moments” of a young woman in distress in an
                    environment that should foster anything but. The display is
                    strategically planned to further emphasize the previously implied
                    aesthetics through color by incorporating purple neon lighting
                    and semi-transparent prints so that the light shines through
                    the photos. Ultimately, the meaning of Why Is It So Hard To
                    Accept The Party Is Over is the darker motivations behind social
                    substance use masked by the ambiance of a party.
