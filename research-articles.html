								<h2>Machine learning for Internet of Things data analysis: A survey</h2>
									<p><i>Article Citation</i>: Mahdavinejad, Mohammad Saeid, et al. "Machine
                    learning for Internet of Things data analysis: A survey." <i>Digital
                      Communications and Networks</i> 4.3 (2018): 161-175.
			            </p>
									<p>The goals of this survey article are to discuss the evolution of data
                    hand in hand with machine learning techniques. Further, it discusses how
                    machine learning can be used to extract higher levels of information,
                    essentially at it simplest terms: data. It discusses the potential techniques
                    associated with such.
									</p>
									<p>The general tasks that the methods address in this article is how machine
                    learning can algorithmically be applied to higher levels of data information
                    or smart data, the taxonomy of such algorithms, and why smart city is a typical
                    use case in regards to the "Internet of Things".
                  </p>
                  <p> The leading methods introduced and discussed within this paper follow the
                    same structure of the general tasks that I have already previously discussed
                    in the general tasks of this paper, but of course, follow along those tasks
                    more in-depth. For example, when regarding the "Internet of Things" (IoT)
                    architecture, applications of such heavily invoke Communication protocols,
                    computing frameworks, the architecture itself, and smart city segments.
                    The paper heavily finds its focus in the newness (relative sense because
                    of the date that the paper was written, that being nearly five years ago)
                    of the concept of IoT and the navigation of such with machine learning
                    algorithms and data parsing.
                  </p>
                  <p>In regards to IoT specifically, the context of the method discussions
                    are heavily focused on "smart city" use cases and how the implementation
                    of such in urban settings is a great example of why machine learning
                    algorithms are essential in data access and analysis. In simpler terms,
                    the digitization (heavily emphasized in a computational sense, not in
                    the literal sense of the word) of urbanization is referenced as the
                    primary demonstration of these applications of machine learning algorithms.
                  </p>
                  <p>These methods could certainly be used in my own work, definitely with less
                    of an emphasis on smart cities, but rather using the techniques of the machine
                    learning algorithms to assist me in my data analysis. Essentially, making use
                    of these algorithms in my own work both invoke things that I am certainly
                    passionate about and that I feel that would highly benefit my work tremendously.

								<h2>A Literature Review of Music in Computer Science</h2>
									<p><i>Article Citation</i>:  Warnars, Harco, and Winston Rusli. "A Literature
                    Review of Music in Computer Science." <i>International Journal of Computing
                      and Digital System</i> (2021).</p>
									<p>The goal of this article is discussing the relations of computer science
                    and music and how a close relationship between the two situationally can
                    be incredibly beneficial to both art forms, despite the computer science
                    not traditionally being viewed as an art form by outside perspectives.
                  </p>
                  <p>The main goal of this article is essentially the combination or collaboration
                    between computer science and music. This main goal is split into sections,
                    starting with discussions of the rise in popularity and general notoriety of
                    digital music, the integration of computer science into music education, and
                    further into the concept of music creation using computer science.
                  </p>
                  <p>These goals may seem quite different when viewed individually but throughout
                    the article they tie together rather well, discussing already existing
                    applications for each of the individual sections and ultimately creating
                    the relationship between the existing three and tying it to the evolution
                    of the music industry through digitization. It considers the potential
                    negative impacts of such but tries to bring attention to the positives.

								<h2>Data portability effects on data-driven innovation of online platforms: Analyzing Spotify</h2>
									<p><i>Article Citation</i>: Ramos, Esmeralda Florez, and Knut Blind. "Data
                    portability effects on data-driven innovation of online platforms: Analyzing Spotify."
                    <i>Telecommunications Policy</i> 44.9 (2020): 102026.
                  </p>
										<p>The goal of this article is to discuss the aspects of data collection and portability,
                      specifically with Spotify and views such within the scope of the European Union
                      (EU), specifically within the EU General Data Protection Regulation. Additionally,
                      it discusses the competitors within the scope of data portability, including
                      Spotify, Google, and Facebook.
                    </p>
										<p>The main goal of this article is to inform the potential effects (truthfully,
                      we could observe such in real time because this article is from three years ago)
                      of data portability in online applications, specifically in the bigger competitors
                      in the context of online platforms.
                    </p>
										<p>More specifically, the article discusses the effects of data portability in regards
                      to Spotify and heavily emphasizes the potential implications of such in the music
                      platform's evolution and ultimately its success. It explores all aspects of how
                      Spotify utilizes data and even references data from Spotify specifically to cover
                      all of their figurative bases in the potential implications and effects this
                      policy within the EU.
                    </p>
                    <p>As an unofficial note, I understand evaluating data portability with Spotify
                      in the scope of the EU may not seem incredibly relevant, however, the inclusion
                      of such in my research is incredibly helpful in understanding the impact in my
                      work and also helps foster thoughts involving the ethicality in my work and
                      ensuring I am being ethical in my technical work, specifically with data
                      collection. Fortunately, Spotify has already kept me checked and balanced
                      in the sense that collecting and storing user data (within databases
                      especially) is a violation of their terms of service, thus there was no
                      room for error in the sense of ethicality.
