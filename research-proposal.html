									<h1>Final<br />
									Research Proposal</h1>
									<p>To culminate it all and wrap it tightly.</p>
								</header>
								<h2>Preamble</h2>
									<p>Finding my exact intentions with what I wanted to propose
                    as my research topic was most definitely the hardest part of
                    determining what I was to do. I felt myself stuck in the cycle
                    of wanting to somehow shoehorn the project I was pursuing during
                    a grand majority of the semester into this research topic, but
                    I knew it just did not quite fit.</p>
                  <p>Good news, the hard part is over, or at least it is for me. Below, I will take you along the journey that I had undergone in finding my research topic and hopefully after you read this, you will agree with my desires to pursue research here.</p>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                  <p>My intended research that I plan to propose here finds itself in the world of machine learning. I specifically want to use machine learning to explore a theory by Laura Mulvey, that theory specifically being about the male gaze. Laura Mulvey's "Male Gaze Theory" is based on a concept observed in cinema, but with the constant and swift evolution of accessible media, the male gaze finds itself more and more present in each of our day to day routines. The theory itself is the concept of women (in Mulvey's theorizing, she refers to women in media) of being viewed through the point of view of a heterosexual man. Now, as a clarifier, this concept of a heterosexual man in this theory is boiled down to women being perceived as lesser, as passive objects to be desired by the theoretical "heterosexual man"; this definition does not mean to cast this entire category, that being heterosexual men under this umbrella of where their primary view is not considering women equally. Regardless of these clarifications, social media is a large contender for encouraging the mindset of the male gaze.</p>
                  <p>I am certainly not the first to research theory, and hopefully I will not be the last. A specific study that I appreciated in the development of this research idea was Rachel M. Calogero's "A Test of Objectification Theory: The Effect of Male Gaze on Appearance Concerns in College Women", in this study it extends the research on objectification theory using 105 female undergraduate students and their behaviors when either expecting a male or female gaze.</p>
                  <p>I chose to pursue this avenue of research because of my attitude and somewhat distaste towards how the male gaze has found itself in the back of a lot of our minds and influences how we consume media.</p>
                  <p>Ultimately, how I want to employ and propose research around this topic is to combine both of my respective studies, those being Computer Science and Art, Science and Innovation to research the occurrence of behaviors affiliated with the male gaze and present my findings artistically.</p>
                  <p>I intend to do such by writing eye tracking software that can identify one's eye movements through a combination of facial recognition along with eye recognition using classifiers made available to me through OpenCV to assist in identifying the eyes and ultimately identifying and recording their movements in correlation to a set of images and analyze the data for patterns and differences per image. Further from that, I plan to cross reference this to further research on the male gaze theory or even objectification theory to produce an artistic presentation of this phenomena using generative art strategies with Python.</p>
                <h2>Background</h2>
                  <p>In order to conduct research in this area and be able to conceptualize and develop a tool to aid in generating or gathering data from a participant study, it is necessary to consider the potentially needed tools to help achieve this.</p>
                  <p>Rome was not built in a day, but shamelessly, I will admit this research proposal's prototype was. However, the sole intention in calling attention to that point was to segue into the necessity of tools to assist in the creation of the software (in this case, a very rudimentary edition of such) to ensure there is little room for error and that the program runs as intended.</p>
                  <p>In order to achieve this, I fell upon the help of OpenCV and various tutorials to assist me in developing the prototyped product. I also recognize that Pytorch may be a helpful addition to later releases of the software because it is an open source framework for machine learning, which is what I am trying to achieve a prototype with such qualities in order to gather data.</p>
                  <p>In addition to OpenCV, I also found helpful classifiers that aided in the identification of a face in a picture or video and also in the identification of the eyes which ultimately brought me to where I felt that I needed to be to demonstrate the sound logic behind my research.</p>
                <h2>Knowledge Gap</h2>
                  <p>While conducting preliminary research before finding myself set on proposing this specific area of research, I did find myself asking questions about the type of technology I intended to use to conduct research for my proposed project. These gaps were brought to me organically, I would find myself looking to acquire more information or knowledge on certain concepts affiliated with the individual components of my research.</p>
                  <p>Specifically, I found some experiments and explorations of specific areas that I wanted to become more knowledgeable in that I realized did not have a great amount of information out there about. For instance, I found an article by Alejandro Susillo-Ridao and others that discussed the connection between emotional expression in the face with learning and identifying who may need more assistance based on analysis of these facial features. This correlates rather well with my intended research, but also left me with a couple of questions of my own on what I could further do to fine tune what I intend to accomplish with this research.</p>
                  <p>It did raise questions that correlated to this knowledge gap, those being:</p>
                  <p><b>How do specific patterns of eye movement correlate to perceptions of what is being viewed?</b></p>
                  <p><b>How can I use the data recorded from eye movement to generate some sort of visual manipulation to the media being observed?</b></p>
                  <p>Finding the answers to these are a process that would occur through the process of experimentation and research. These questions are important in defining what needs to be observed in my proposed project, but they also raise several more specific questions when further clarified and specified.</p>
                  <p>However, I truly feel that through the act of research and experimentation in this project will bring these answers to rest, it is a process that comes together by bringing in relevant information and adhering it along with the research like a puzzle piece and drawing conclusions from such.</p>
                <h2>Scope and Feasibility</h2>
                  <p>I have already identified two questions in the previous section, particularly referencing the physiological and technological logic behind eye movement or eye tracking. These questions are most definitely important in the grand scheme of my proposed research, however in conducting my further due diligence in identifying the scope and feasibility of, it raises questions of how I intend to achieve this intended project.</p>
                  <p>The scope of the project when stripped of context and theoretical connections I plan to make in my research is rather simple; the project requires the development of software that utilizes machine learning for facial artifact identification and recording the paths in which the eyes trace the image and recording data of these paths.</p>
                  <p>I feel that without the extra fluff of the ethical connections and considerations I want to explore in this proposed research project, it is a reasonable inference to make that this project is feasible considering the scope that it is being restricted to in conducting research.</p>
                  <p>I will acknowledge that the artistic presentation of this project, which would be created and conducted after the initial research and background is completed has less of a concrete idea of feasibility with my current proposition to artistic presentation. However, that is simply the beauty of art and its ability to evolve regardless of the findings of the experimental research.\</p>
                <h2>Prototype and Experiment</h2>
                  <p>The prototype that was developed in this course heavily supports the idea that this proposed project is incredibly feasible. The prototype that was developed is rather simple, utilizing classifiers and functions from the OpenCV library to build its utmost function, to demonstrate ability to track eyes, specifically the movement in the pupils from a video feed.</p>
                  <p>However, this prototype did prove for some difficulty in regards to the experimentation phase of demonstrating functionality.</p>
                  <p>In order to create a prototype that I felt properly demonstrated technology that would be necessary in my proposed research, I did not create a program that was incredibly compatible to conduct the types of experiments that I was being asked of.</p>
                  <p>I conducted experimental strategies in determining how to develop the refinement of the eye identification in order to properly identify eye movement tracing and had to experiment with different values and inputs to get a desired result.</p>
                  <p>However, again, revisiting the expected experiments with the prototypes, I simply did not create something incredibly compatible with experimentation relevant to my proposed research. I was able to document that I am able to record data of the position of my eyes in relation to the screen in front of me and further can draw the conclusion that I can create paths based on these values, however, due to the lack of ability to test with many others I did not officially conduct an experiment beyond personal testing to my satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Ultimately, the "experiments" conducted here still provide great value to supporting the potential project's merits. The development of refined techniques to identify eye movement in the prototype was a success in supporting the logic model powering the entire proposed research project.</p>
                <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
                  <p>In regards to the ethicality of this proposed project, I feel that it is fairly ethical. It takes focus in urging readers or observers of the work conducted here to consider the issues that arise with the predominant presence of the male gaze in our own impressions of women or feminine bodies. Additionally, with the continuous evolution and ease of accessibility to social media, the ability to objectify with the male gaze has become even easier that I felt compelled to pursue research of such.</p>
                  <p>I will acknowledge, my proposed project is heavily reliant on being participant based, so ethically there must be considerations to that nature. I would have to be incredibly careful with data recording to ensure that no one's personal data that I have collected has the potential to leak in any way or form. While the experiment would not produce or gather any data that is incriminating, it would not shed the participant in the best light based on their behaviors with eye movement in correlation with the media being presented to them.</p>
                  <p>When considering the artistic presentation of this project, the line of ethicality becomes somewhat blurry. I do not, by any means, intend to produce work that is unethical but the methodology of the final artistic interpretation is still to be determined and considering my artistic stylings, it could somewhat be interpreted as vulgar or brash or harsh, however I do assure that it will not be considered truly unethical or use any unethical means in its production.</p>
                <h2>Next Steps</h2>
                  <p>After conducting this (somewhat) preliminary research and creating a prototype to demonstrate the validity of the pursuit of this specific research, questions may arise asking what is to follow.</p>
                  <p>I want to continue to further research other topics that would be helpful in the artistic presentation of the product of the research. While I recognize that this could somewhat be perceived as getting ahead of myself, it would just be to ensure that a proposed final presentation is feasible.</p>
                  <p>I would also like to continue further technological research in tuning the software affiliated with the research to be appropriate in relation to my knowledge and experience in computer science. This would be to demonstrate knowledge in the subject, yes, but ultimately it is to develop a program that best assists in the unbiased data collection of eye movement.</p>
                  <p>I also recognize that further researching psychological patterns with eye movement and determining how exactly I will be able to conduct an experiment that does not reveal to the participant what they are being measured for, in order to not skew the results.</p>
                  <p>Ultimately, the next steps are to continue earnestly in pursuit of knowledge and to hopefully discover and call attention to my findings.</p>
