									<h1>NextJS<br />
									Bite-Sized Guide</h1>
									<p>Quick guide and introduction to NextJS.</p>
								</header>
								<h2>About</h2>
									<p>The software resource that I have elected to create a tutorial for is
									<a href="https://nextjs.org/">NextJS</a> by Vercel. Next.js is a framework
									of React, which is a Javascript library for building user interfaces. Some
									notable websites, services, or applications built using the framework are
									Hulu, Staples, Nike, the mobile version of Twitch, among other popular sites
									as well.</p>
									<p>Why I feel that this software resource may have relevance to my topic is
										because I feel that I am most likely to pursue a topic that would be brought
										to fruition as an online application, as in, it is easily accessible by all
										versus something that would require installs.
									</p>
									<p>I particularly am partial to pursuing further information on this software
									resource because I have previously and am currently working with it in a personal
									project. The pursuit of continuing to use it is purely based in the fact that I
									would like to hone my skills with it and use it as effectively as possible, like
									how other sites and applications have done.</p>
								<h2>Features</h2>
									<p>I feel that the visual features and ability integrated into Next.js are great
									for a good variety of topics that I may want to pursue. I am fairly certain
									that I would like to pursue an online application that is easily accessible
									to all and using this, that becomes fairly easily achievable. Particularly
									in the case of data analysis, there is easy protocol for data fetching that
									make things much simpler and easier in regards to achievement.</p>
									<p>Next.js, as previously mentioned, is a framework of React. Next.js,
										however, has the ability to build server-side rendered applications.
										Next.js functions similarly to other frameworks, such as Angular.
										They surely have their similarities, but when it came down to preference
										the features and overall functionality won me over.</p>
								<h2>Obtaining the Resource</h2>
									<p>I found this resource when looking for a framework that had the ability
										to build server-side rendered applications. It is open source, but not
										explicitly stated on their website or documentation, however clarified
										with their MIT license. Installation is rather simple, a guide is provided
										<a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started">here</a> but in quick
										explanation it is:</p>
										<p><b>npx create-next-app@latest</b></p>
										<p>This generates a blank project with everything already set up. If you
											wish to have this project be Typescript based, you would us the flag
											<b>--typescript</b>.</p>
										<p>Alternatively, if you would like to set it up manually, you would
											follow the manual setup on the
											<a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started">Getting Started</a> guide.
								<h2>Setup</h2>
									<p>Truthfully, you could the software to run fairly easily out of the box when
										using the standard setup command for Next.js, which is <b>npx create-next-app@latest</b>
										as previously mentioned.</p>
									<p>The only further step that has to be taken for deployment is actual deployment
										(like, through a service) or test deployment enabled through:</p>
									<p><b>npm run dev</b></p>
									<p>Next.js is a framework of React, heavily relying on Javascript <i>(or .jsx, .ts,
										.tsx, et cetera)</i>, which explains the heavy involvement of using <b>npm</b>
										and <b>npx</b> for package and dependency handling for it.</p>
									<p>Other than that, setup relies on your own manual configurations in creating
									the application.</p>
								<h2>Execution</h2>
									<p>Getting the resource ready to use is fairly simple. With the automatic setup
										option, Next.js runs straight out of box. For development purposes, the
										demonstration of the application can be done with <b>npm run dev</b> and
										final deployment could be handled by however you would elect to host your
										application.</p>
								<h2>Helpful Resources</h2>
									<p>Truthfully, most of my knowledge with this framework has been acquired
										over time. However, the documentation for Next.js is incredibly well written
										and detailed... So I got most of my knowledge from <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started">there</a>.</p>
